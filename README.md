The process of granting permission to students to leave college early can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The current system, which relies on paper and manual entry, is often inefficient and creates a significant workload for the concerned authorities. In order to improve this process, it is necessary to adopt a more efficient and reliable solution.

The Automated Student Permission System is designed to address these challenges by providing a digital solution for granting student departures. This system is an electronic sign-out sheet that can be accessed by students using their college ID. When a student wants to leave early, they log in to the system and enter the reason for leaving and the desired time. The request is then sent to the concerned authorities for review and approval.

The implementation of the Automated Student Permission System has the potential to revolutionize the process of granting permission to students to leave college early. It provides a more efficient and cost-effective solution, eliminates the need for manual entry, and reduces the risk of errors. Furthermore, the system provides a secure and auditable record of all sign-out requests.

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a functional Automated Student Permission System and evaluate its performance and effectiveness. The results of this study will contribute to the understanding of the potential benefits and limitations of digital solutions for managing student departures.
